## Hey, I'm Udhav 👋

I'm a developer who enjoys solving problems with structure and simplicity. Currently working as an Associate Solution Engineer at FarEye, I specialize in building full-stack applications that focus on functionality, design, and maintainability.

### 🛠 What I work with
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Next.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js, NestJS, TypeScript, Express  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Sequelize, Mongoose  
- **Dev Practices:** REST APIs, Repository Pattern, Service Layer Architecture

I'm drawn to design patterns and love thinking deeply about how things should work before writing code.

> “Design is how it works.”  
Whether it’s software or art, I believe everything meaningful is a result of thoughtful design.
